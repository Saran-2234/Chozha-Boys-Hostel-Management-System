# Integrate Student Approval API Response

## Tasks
- [x] Update handleConfirmApprove in Students.jsx to parse and utilize the API response data
- [x] Extract student details from the response and update local student object
- [x] Add proper error handling for response structure
- [x] Correct HTTP method from PUT to POST for approve endpoint
- [x] Test the approval flow to ensure data is updated correctly

## Details
The backend API returns student details in the approval response. Currently, the frontend only updates the status to 'active' but doesn't use the returned student data. We need to integrate this response to update the student information with the latest data from the backend.

## Files to Edit
- src/admin Dashboard/Students/Students.jsx

## Changes Made
- Modified handleConfirmApprove function to parse API response
- Added logic to merge student details from response with local data
- Added fallback for cases where response doesn't contain student details
- Updated success message to use response message when available
